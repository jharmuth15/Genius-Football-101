    Congratiulatons, you have made it to the penalties page.  Before you look through this page, I reccomend you look at the NFL teams page first, as some examples will show certain teams doing certain penalties.  The first thing you should know about penalties, is what the referee does when a penalty is called:  He throws a yellow flag.

      <li> Penalty is 95% of the time against the Offense.</li>
      <li>Delay of Game is when the offensive team is penalized five yards for delay of game if it fails to put the ball in play by either snap or free kick before the play clock expires. It is often 25 seconds from the time the referee signals the ball ready for play. In the National Football League, it can also be 40 seconds from the end of the previous down, depending on the circumstances at the time. Also, the defensive team can be given the same penalty if they fail to quickly yield the ball to officials after a play has ended, prevent a player on the offense from getting up after the play, or kicking the ball.</li>
