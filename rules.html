  <h3> Basics</h3>
<body>
  <p>
One 11-man team has possession of the football. It is called the offense and it tries to advance the ball down the field-by running with the ball or throwing it - and score points by crossing the goal line and getting into an area called the end zone.

The other team (also with 11 players) is called the defense. It tries to stop the offensive team and make it give up possession of the ball. If the team with the ball does score or is forced to give up possession, the offensive and defensive teams switch roles (the offensive team goes on defense and the defensive team goes on offense). And so on, back and forth, until all four quarters of the game have been played.</p>
  </div>
    <div id="Field">
  <h3> The Field</h3>
  <p> The field measures 100 yards long and 53 yards wide. Probably the most important part of the field is the end zone. It's an additional 10 yards on each end of the field. This is where the points add up! When the offense - the team with possession of the ball-gets the ball into the opponent's end zone, they score points.</p>
  </div>
    <div id="Timing">
  <h3> Timing</h3>
  <p>Games are divided into four 15-minute quarters, separated by a 12-minute break at halftime. There are also 2-minute breaks at the end of the first and third quarters as teams change ends of the field after every 15 minutes of play. At the end of the first and third quarters, the team with the ball retains possession heading into the following quarter. That is not the case before halftime. The second half starts with a kickoff in the same way as the game began in the first quarter.  Each offensive team has 40 seconds from the end of a given play until they must snap of the ball for the start of the next play, otherwise they will be penalized.

The clock stops at the end of incomplete passing plays, when a player goes out of bounds, or when a penalty is called. The clock starts again when the ball is re-spotted by an official.</p>
    </div>
  <div id="Yards">
  <h3> Moving Down the Field</h3>
  <p>All progress in a football game is measured in yards. The offensive team tries to get as much "yardage" as it can to try and move closer to the opponent's end zone. Each time the offense gets the ball, it has four downs, or chances, in which to gain 10 yards. If the offensive team successfully moves the ball 10 or more yards, it earns a first down, and another set of four downs. If the offense fails to gain 10 yards, it loses possession of the ball. </p> 
    </div>
    <div id="Turnovers">
  <h3> Turnovers</h3>
  <p>THE FUMBLE:
When the ball carrier or passer drops the ball, that's a fumble. Any player on the field can recover the ball by diving on it or he can run with it. The team that recovers a fumble either gets-or retains-possession of the ball.</p>
<p>THE INTERCEPTION:
    
An aggressive defense can regain possession of the ball by catching (intercepting) passes meant for players on the other team. Both fumble recoveries and interceptions can be run back into the end zone for touchdowns. </p>
    </div>
  <div id="Positions">
  <h3> Positions</h3>
  <h4>Offensive positions</h4>
<p>  <ul>
    <li> The Quarterback ("QB") passes or hands off the ball.</li>
    <li>The Center snaps the ball to the QB and blocks the defense.</li>
     <li>2 Guards and 2 Tackles keep the defense at bay.</li>
    <li>2/4 Wide Receivers catch the ball thrown by the QB.</li>
    <li>1 or 2 running backs take the ball and run with it.</li>
  <li>1 or 2 Tight Ends block the defense and can also catches passes.</li></P>
    </ul>
    <h4> Defensive positions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Linebackers defend against the pass, and push forward to stop the run or tackle the QB.</li>
      <li>The defensive line (ends and tackles) battles head-to-head against the offensive line.
      </li>
      <li>Cornerbacks and safeties defend against the pass from the QB to the wide receiver and help to stop the run.</li>
